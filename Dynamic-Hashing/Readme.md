Dynamic Hashing using Binary Tree
=================================

Program implements dynamic hashing controlled through binary indexing in a binary tree. Each node of the tree can hold certain number of elements in it defined by the page size after which it is split or on need basis depending on the binary sequence of the input element/number. 

Enter The Number In the Usual manner they would be converted to binary by the program itself and saved. At any stage you can get a view of the numbers using option 2. The Actual Implementation Behind is that Of Binary Trees. The page size can also be changed according to the user requirement before run time at the top using the variable PAGE. Set this according to your need.
